# Neckbeard OS

An opinionated custom meme OS we are building, just cause we can, to test & try out various things and to learn how to create our own Linux OS/distribution.

We will be primarily focusing on RISC-V architecture, due to our personal interest in that architecture, don't be surprised if there are things related to amd64/x64_86 & arm64/aarch64 architecture as well or just other random stuff.
